## ðŸ”±Purpose

After all this year that I improved myself, I just wanted to create all of my old projects to renew and add to my own showcase. Nowadays, I want to test myself on what I learned during doing the job and what kind of ideas/concepts I get from my job. I decided to start with [Kesy](https://github.com/altaysimsek/Kesyme) first to renew my old projects.

Started with creating a design from scratch on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/zv2mogIX5PlsPgdewIZmnQ/Kesy?type=design&node-id=0:1&mode=design&t=ma3l0XbJgwEIMiQR-1). To create this design, I inspired from really great UI/UX designer.


In this project, I want to completely understand these concepts below:

 - Web Performance
 - Authentication
 - Web Vitals
 - Simple BFF
 - Caching
 - SSR
 - CI/CD (vercel handle it already)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
